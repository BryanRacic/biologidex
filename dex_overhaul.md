- The "dex" system represents all the animals ever photographed by an individual user
    - Users can view their own "dex" or the "dex" of their friends
- Whenever a user opens their "dex" on the client
    - A request should be sent to the server for a list of that user's dex entries
        - This should return a list of dex entry UUIDs and each of their `last_updated` at times (which includes the `last updated` time of the associated animal image).
    - The client should compare this list of dex entries with those stored locally
        - If any dex entry is missing locally, or has been updated more recently according to the server: then the client should make a request to download that dex entry locally (including the associated dex-compatible image) 
        - The client app should automatically display the downloaded dex data images in the `dex` page as they become available
- Future additions
    - Users can replace images on dex entries with any image of that specific animal that they've ever saved/uploaded
    - Users can make custom "dex" collections with friends by combining entries into a shared collaborative "dex"
    - Dex entries will eventually be expanded to `dex pages` where information from `dex` and `animal` records can be combined and customized into scrabook-style field journals.
        - These allow for personalization of the design & layout, listing of additional details about this specific animal/image, and can be shared and combined w/ finds in "dex collections"
