Please update the `scripts/animal_id_benchmark.py` script to expand upon the existing API docs sample provided. This script needs to iterate over the test images in `resources/test_images`, and test them on different image recognition methods. This will begin w/ just testing different OpenAI models & detail methods, but should be sufficiently abstracted to support any CV method. Please replace all print statements with log messages (writing to a file named `animal_id_bechmark.log`), ensure the cost, runtime, and a comparison of image contents (resources/test_images/image_key.csv) vs each prediction/model response are included. Abstract the prompt to a constant at the top of the file
